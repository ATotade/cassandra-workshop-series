`Cassandra Workshop Series` are an interactive experience. Datastax Developer Advocates share some knowledge about Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ NoSQL database and how you build Cloud Native applications. You interact with them through chats *([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAIQY251avaMv7bBv5PCo-A) and [discord](https://discord.com/widget?id=685554030159593522&theme=dark))*, quizzes (menti.com), and exercises. 

In this repository, you'll find everything you need related to `week 3` of the **Cassandra Worskhop Series**. For simplicity all exercise instructions will be listed in a single `README` for each language: Java, Javascript, Python, CSharp. We recommended you to have some previous experience with the language you choose. 

Now if you are NOT familiar with any of those, we recommended to use Python, the is the simplest. Ready ? go !

- **Create the Data Model (reminders)**

[done during week 3](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-series/tree/master/week3-AppDev-crud#2-exercise--the-spacecraft-nodebook)

## 2. Exercise : Start the backend

### 2.1 Start the JAVA BACKEND

![JAVA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-series/master/materials/images/logo-java.png)

This provides an example REST backend built in Java using `Spring Boot`. This application serves as the connection between the UI website and an underlying Astra database. It has Swagger installed.

Creation of `CqlSession` objects within an application is an expensive process as they take awhile to initialize and become aware of the clusters topology.  Due to this it is a best practice to create a `CqlSession` object once per application and reuse it throughout the entire lifetime of that application.

`SessionManager` implements the Singleton pattern to handle a single instance of the `CqlSession` object. Note that this is the only bean not initialized by Spring at startup. This is only when you have provided the secure credential bundle that we can initiate a connection.

#### 2.1.1 Run the Java Backend in gitpod

**‚úÖ  Open gitpod** : [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an IDE 100% online based on Eclipse Theia. To initialize your environment simply click on the button below *(CTRL + Click to open in new tab)*

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-series)

Target url looks like  `https://<your_uid>.<your_region>.gitpod.io/#/workspace/cassandra-workshop-series`. These URL's are dynamic and we cannot provide clickable links in advance. You will need to copy-paste `<your_uid>.<your_region>` as we will insert them in each URL during the exercises.

```

By default Autosave is not enabled in Gitpod. Don't forget to save your modifications with CTRL+S
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

![Splash](images/gitpod-splash.png?raw=true)

**That's it.** Gitpod provides all tools we will need today including `maven`,`pip`,`npm`. At initialization of the workspace we schedule a command to download dependencies.

**‚úÖ Start SpringBoot**

Move to folder ` week4-AppDev-api` to get the exercises of the week and `getting-started-with-astra-java` to work with JAVA.

```
cd week4-AppDev-api/getting-started-with-astra-java
mvn spring-boot:run
```

You should be able to access to the UI with. Note that the `8080` port has been redirected to port `80` but changing the URL with a `8080` prefix and enforcing HTTPS. With the UI (swagger) you can start executing some requests against the REST API

```
https://8080-<your_uid>.<your_region>.gitpod.io/swagger-ui.html
```


#### 2.1.2 Run the java Backend locally

**‚úÖ Prerequisites**

* Java 11+
* An Astra compatible Java driver, instructions may be found [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/aws/doc/dscloud/astra/dscloudConnectJavaDriver.html) to install this locally.
* An Astra database with the CQL schema located in [schema.cql](src/main/resources/schema.cql) already added.
* The username, password, keyspace name, and secure connect bundle downloaded from your Astra Database.  For information on how to obtain these credentials please read the documentation found [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/aws/doc/dscloud/astra/dscloudObtainingCredentials.html).

**‚úÖ Start SpringBoot**

This application is a Spring Boot web application. This sample can be run from the root directory using:
```
cd getting-started-with-astra-java
mvn spring-boot:run
```
This will startup the application running on `http://localhost:8080`
You will know that you are up and working when you get the following in your terminal window:

```
16:23:01.569 INFO  com.datastax.astra.GettingStartedWithAstra  : Started GettingStartedWithAstra in 1.851 seconds (JVM running for 2.39)
```

**‚úÖ Access the API from a browser**

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

*Note: If you want to change the listening port of the application, locate the file `src/main/resources/application.yml` and change key `server.port`*

### 2.2 Start the PYTHON BACKEND

![JAVA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-series/master/materials/images/logo-python.png)

This sample Python backend provides a REST API service that is used with the [Getting Started with Astra UI](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-ui) to show a
simple example of how to connect to and query DataStax Astra databases. This application serves as the connection between the UI website and an underlying Astra database. 

**Objectives**
- How to connect to Astra using the Secure Connect Bundle
- How to manage a Cassandra Session within a Python web application

**Project Layout**
- [getting_started_with_astra.py](getting_started_with_astra.py) - entrypoint for the backend, registers controller blueprints with Flask app
- [schema.cql](schema.cql) - database schema used by the application
- [service](service/) - acts as the middle-man to take requests from the controllers and calls the corresponding dao methods.
Note how this and [session_manager.py](dao/session_manager.py) are used to share a single DataStax Driver Session across API requests, this is a best practice.
- [model](model/) - defines the Python objects that correspond to the database tables
- [dao](dao/) - methods for accessing the database, contains the DataStax Driver API calls
- [controller](controller/) - defines the API endpoints using Flask decorators

**How this works**
This project is built in Python and uses Flask to expose a REST API backend for use with the [Getting Started with Astra UI](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-ui).

This application is the middle man that receives requests from the UI web page and serves data from the underlying DataStax Astra database.

### 2.2.1 Run the Python Backend locally

*Note: You cannot run this application on GitPod. This application needs to be run locally.*

**‚úÖ Prerequisites**

* Python 3.6 or newer
* An Astra compactible python driver, instructions may be found [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/aws/doc/dscloud/astra/dscloudConnectPythonDriver.html)
* An Astra database with the CQL schema located in [schema.cql](schema.cql) already added.
* The username, password, keyspace name, and secure connect bundle downloaded from your Astra Database.  For information on how to obtain these credentials please read the documentation found [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/aws/doc/dscloud/astra/dscloudObtainingCredentials.html).

This appliation uses the Flask framework. This sample can be run from the root directory.

**‚úÖ Installation procedure**

**a) Setup environment**

We advise that you set up a virtual python environment with Python 3 first (e.g with pyenv or venv).
To setup a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

```
python3 -m venv astra-venv
cd astra-venv
source bin/activate
```
The activation will prepend your command prompt with `(astra-venv)`, indicating that you are operating in your virtual environment.  All dependencies will be installed into this environment only.

**b) install dependencies**
```
pip install Flask flask-cors cassandra-driver
```

#### c) Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-series
```

**‚úÖ Starting procedure**

Go to the directory that you just cloned this repo into
```
cd getting-started-with-astra-python
python getting-started-with-astra.py
```

This will start the application running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

You should see the following output:
```
 $ python getting_started_with_astra.py 
 * Serving Flask app "getting_started_with_astra" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**c) Access the API documentation from a browser**
[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

*Note: If you want to change the listening port of the application, change it in the app.run() call in `getting-started-with-astra.py`, eg*

```
app.run(port=5001)
```

#### 2.2.2 Run in gitpod

**‚úÖ  Open gitpod** : [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an IDE 100% online based on Eclipse Theia. To initialize your environment simply click on the button below *(CTRL + Click to open in new tab)*

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-series)

**‚úÖ Installation procedure**

```
pip install Flask flask-cors cassandra-driver
```

**‚úÖ Starting the Flask application procedure**

Move to folder ` week4-AppDev-api` to get the exercises of the week and `getting-started-with-astra-python` to work with PYTHON.

```
cd week4-AppDev-api/getting-started-with-astra-python
python getting-started-with-astra.py
```

You should be able to access to the UI with. Note that the `8080` port has been redirected to port `80` but changing the URL with a `8080` prefix and enforcing HTTPS. With the UI (swagger) you can start executing some requests against the REST API.

```
https://5000-<your_uid>.<your_region>.gitpod.io/swagger-ui.html
```

It's open, but there is nothing to see:

```
Not Found
The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.
```

You will see an `Open Ports` tab in the gitpod terminal window, where you can check on the status of the ports and access previews and browsers. 


*Note: If you want to change the listening port of the application, change it in the app.run() call in `getting-started-with-astra.py`, eg*

```
app.run(port=5001)
```

### 3.4 Start the CSHARP BACKEND

![JAVA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-series/master/materials/images/logo-csharp.png)

#### 3.4.1 Run locally

**TODO**

#### 3.4.2 Run in gitpod

*N/A as of now, we did not setup gitpod to work with dotnet.*


## 3. Exercise : Start the UI

This provides the front end for the Astra Getting Started application. This is meant to be used with one of the following backends (java, python, csharp)

**Objectives**
- Connect a web application to one of four backends to demonstrate an end to end full stack application
- Demonstrate how to properly page results for an Astra Service

![UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-workshop-series/master/week4-AppDev-api/images/ui.png)

### 3.1 Run locally

**Prerequisites**

- node v8.1.0

**Running**

A `.env` file is required before you can build the application. This file needs to be added to the root of the project and called .env. This file contains all the environment variables required for the application. Currently there is only one required entry:

```
BASE_ADDRESS=http://localhost:5000/api
```
This value is where you put the relative address of the api.

In order to start this application you need to run:

```
npm install
```
and then

```
npm run start
```
You will know that this is correctly running when you see this message in your terminal:

```
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: Project is running at http://localhost:3000/
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: webpack output is served from /
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: Content not from webpack is served from /Users/dave.bechberger/Documents/projects/bechbd/getting-started-with-astra-ui
‚Ñπ ÔΩ¢wdsÔΩ£: 404s will fallback to /index.html
```

If you would like to build this for deployment then this can be accomplished using:

```
npm run build
```

## 3.2 Run in gitpod

Locate the folder and install the dependencies:
```
cd week4-AppDev-api/getting-started-with-astra-ui 
npm install
```

A `.env` file is required before you can build the application. This file needs to be added to the root of the project and called .env. This file contains all the environment variables required for the application. Currently there is only one required entry:

```
echo 'BASE_ADDRESS=https://<your_port>-<your_id>.<your_region>.gitpod.io/api' > .env
cat .env
```

- <your_port>: Would be `8080` is you pick the Jaba Backend, `5000` if you pick the python backend and `5001` if you pick the CSharp backend.

```
npm run start
```

Your should be able to access
```
https://3000-<your_uid>.<>your_region.gitpod.io/
```
