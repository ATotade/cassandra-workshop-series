`Cassandra Workshop Series` are an interactive experience. Datastax Developer Advocates share some knowledge about  Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ NoSQL database amd how yo build Cloud Native applicationss. You interact with them through chats *([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAIQY251avaMv7bBv5PCo-A) and [discord](https://discord.com/widget?id=685554030159593522&theme=dark))*, quizzes (menti.com), and  exercises. 

In this repository, you'll find everything you need related to `week 3` of the **Cassandra Worskhop Series**. For simplicity all exercises instructions will be listed in a single `README` for each language: Java, Javascript, Python, CSharp. We recommended you to have a previous experience with the language when you pick it. 

Now if you are NOT familiar with any of those, we recommended to use Python, the is the simplest. Ready ? go !

## 1. Create your Astra instance (reminders)

`ASTRA` service is available at url [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com/)

**‚úÖ Step 1a.Register (if needed) and Sign In to Astra** : You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`

- [Registration Page](https://astra.datastax.com/register)

![Registration Image](images/astra-create-register.png?raw=true)

- [Authentication Page](https://astra.datastax.com/)

![Login Image](images/astra-create-login.png?raw=true)


### Step 1b.Fill the Create New Database Form

As you don't have have any instances the login will route through the instance creation form. You will find below which values to enter for each field.

![Database Form](images/astra-create-2.png?raw=true)


- **Set the Compute Size**: For the work we are doing please use `Free tier`. You instance will be there forever, free of charge

- **Select the region**: This is the region where your database will reside physically (choose one close to you or your users). For people in EMEA please use `europe-west-1` idea here is to reduce latency.

- **Fill in the database name** - `killrvideocluster.` While Astra allows you to fill in these fields with values of your own choosing, please follow our reccomendations to make the rest of the exercises easier to follow. If you don't, you are on your own! :)

- **Fill in the keyspace name** - `killrvideo`. It's really important that you use the name killrvideo (with no 'e' in "killr") here in order for all the exercises to work well. We realize you want to be creative, but please just roll with this one today.

- **Fill in the Database User name** - `KVUser`. Note the user name is case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Fill in the password** - `KVPassword`. Fill in both the password and the confirmation fields. Note that the password is also case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Launch the database**. Review all the fields to make sure they are as shown, and click the Launch Database button.

### Step 1c.View your Database and connect

View your database. It may take 2-3 minutes for your database to spin up. You will receive an email at that point. But, go ahead and continue with the rest of the exercise now.

![View Database](images/astra-create-4.png?raw=true)


Once Database is ready you should see the following home page:

![Home Page](images/astra-create-5.png?raw=true)


Let‚Äôs review the database you have configured. In the box on the left side of the window, you can see the database and keyspace name metadata. The box on the right describes the size and location of your database along with your estimated cost. Once Astra initializes the database completely, the left box will have connection details.

### Step 1d.Open DataStax Studio

You can click the **Launch Now** link at the bottom of "Connection Details" box on the left to start the tool. Please enter the credentials you used for Astra instance creation.

![Launch Database](images/astra-create-6.png?raw=true)

- **Fill in the Database User name** - `KVUser`. Note the user name is case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Fill in the password** - `KVPassword`. Fill in both the password and the confirmation fields. Note that the password is also case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Click Test**. Wait for a "connected successfully" message before saving.

- **Click Save**. Once you have a positive test then click the **Save** button to launch DataStax Studio.

We will be doing ALL of our exercises using Studio notebooks for this week.

## 2. Exercise : The spacecraft nodebook

**‚úÖ Step 1a. Open DataStax Studio** : Locate  `Launch Developer Studio` on the bottom left part of the screen and click on `Launch now`. Please enter the same credentials you used for instance creation.

![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/launch-studio.png?raw=true)

- **Fill in the Database User name** - `todouser`. Note the user name is case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Fill in the password** - `todopassword`. Fill in both the password and the confirmation fields. Note that the password is also case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/astra-create-6.png?raw=true)

**‚úÖ Step 3e. Import a notebook** : DataStax studio should now be opened.

![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/launch-studio-home.png?raw=true)

- Download locally the file `datastax-studio-notebook.tar` located in `z-materials/notebooks/datastax-studio-notebook.tar` [here](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/notebooks/datastax-studio-notebook.tar?raw=true)

- Import the file in studio with a drag and drop in the Datastax studio window
