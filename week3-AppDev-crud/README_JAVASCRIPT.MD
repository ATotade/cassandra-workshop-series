## 3. Connectivity to Cassandra 

**‚úÖ Step 3a. Fix unit test `Ex02_Connect_to_Cassandra.js`**

- Place you in the folder with the nodejs file in the terminal. And install the dependencies

```
cd week3-AppDev-crud/crud-nodejs/

npm install
```

- Locate the file `db_connection.js` and fill the properties with your Astra informations.

*Do not copy-paste - this is a sample for me.*

```javascript
// This is the Zip file you downloaded
const SECURE_CONNECT_BUNDLE = '/Users/cedricklunven/Downloads/secure-connect-devworkshopdb.zip'
//const SECURE_CONNECT_BUNDLE = '/workspace/cassandra-workshop-series/week3-AppDev-crud/secure-connect-devworkshopdb.zip'
// This is the username, recommended value was KVUser
const USERNAME = "KVUser";
// This is the password, recommended value was KVPassword
const PASSWORD = "KVPassword";
// This is the keyspace name, recommended value was killrvideo
const KEYSPACE = "killrvideo"; 
```

```
‚ö†Ô∏è By default Autosaved is not enabled in Gitpod. Don't forget to save your modifications with CTRL+S
```

You can now execute the code to connect to ASTRA with. 

```bash
node Ex02_Connect_to_Cassandra.js 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
Your are now connected to cluster 'caas-cluster'
SUCCESS
========================================
```

## 4. CREATE READ UPDATE

**‚úÖ Step 4a. Run unit test `Ex03_Query5a_Insert_Journey.js`** to insert a journey in the catalog


```bash
node Ex03_Query5a_Insert_Journey.js 
```

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
Journey created : 76dceda0-c5ee-11ea-a96c-cbbdcb5d7db1
SUCCESS
========================================
```

**‚úÖ Step 4b. Run unit test `Ex04_Query5b_TakeOff.js`** to update the journey and marked started.

In the previous exercises we displayed a journeyID (for me it is `76dceda0-c5ee-11ea-a96c-cbbdcb5d7db1`). Open `Ex04_Query5b_TakeOff.js` locate constant `JOURNEY_ID` and change value with the proper journeyID. 

```javascript
const journey_id = TimeUuid.fromString('<insert_your_id>')
const spacecraft_name = 'Crew Dragon Endeavour,SpaceX'
```

Run the takeoff query by running this test

```bash
node Ex04_Query5b_TakeOff.js 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
9..8..7..6..5..4..3..2..1 Ignition
========================================
Journey 84121060-c66e-11ea-a82e-f931183227ac has now taken off
SUCCESS
```

**‚úÖ Step 4c. Run unit test `Ex05_Query5c_Travel.js`** to simulate a travel in space

Open the file and locate constant `journey_id` and change value with the proper journeyID. 

```javascript
const journey_id = TimeUuid.fromString('<insert_your_id>')
const spacecraft_name = 'Crew Dragon Endeavour,SpaceX'
```

Run the sample

```bash
node Ex05_Query5c_Travel.js 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
{0/50}Travelling..
{1/50}Travelling..
{2/50}Travelling..
{3/50}Travelling..
{4/50}Travelling..
{5/50}Travelling..
{6/50}Travelling..
...
{47/50} Travelling..
{48/50} Travelling..
{49/50} Travelling..
Reading saved for journey 84121060-c66e-11ea-a82e-f931183227ac
========================================
```

**‚úÖ Step 4d. Run unit test `Ex06_Query5d_Landing.js`** update the journey to make it inactive and provide end date. To run the test please execute:

Open the file and locate constant `journey_id` and change value with the proper journeyID. 

```javascript
const journey_id = TimeUuid.fromString('<insert_your_id>')
const spacecraft_name = 'Crew Dragon Endeavour,SpaceX'
```
Now run the sample:

```bash
node Ex06_Query5d_Landing.js 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
========================================
Journey 84121060-c66e-11ea-a82e-f931183227ac has now landed
SUCCESS
```

## 5. READ AND PARSE RESULTS

**‚úÖ Step 5a. Run unit test `Ex07_Query4a_ListJourneys.js`** to list all journeys for a 
spacecraft.

Open the file and locate constant `spacecraft_name` and change value with the proper value you entered. 

```javascript
const spacecraft_name = 'Crew Dragon Endeavour,SpaceX'
```
Now run the sample:

```bash
node Ex07_Query4a_ListJourneys.js 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
========================================
- Journey: 620acae0-c671-11ea-97e7-56004218e25e Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Journey: 87345f00-c66e-11ea-a252-4ebb2901d808 Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Journey: 84121060-c66e-11ea-a82e-f931183227ac Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Journey: 76dceda0-c5ee-11ea-a96c-cbbdcb5d7db1 Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS

- Journey: 90163870-c5d6-11ea-b11f-c30e2b038000 Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
SUCCESS
```

**‚úÖ Step 5b. Run unit test `Ex08_Query4b_Read_Journey_Details.js`** to get the details of one journey

Open the file and locate constant `journey_id` and change value with the proper journeyID. 

```javascript
const journey_id = TimeUuid.fromString('<insert_your_id>')
const spacecraft_name = 'Crew Dragon Endeavour,SpaceX'
```
Now run the file :

```bash
node Ex08_Query4b_Read_Journey_Details.js 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
========================================
Journey has been found
- Uid:		 TimeUuid {
  buffer: <Buffer 84 12 10 60 c6 6e 11 ea a8 2e f9 31 18 32 27 ac>
}
- Spacecraft:	 Crew Dragon Endeavour,SpaceX
- Summary:	 Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Active:	 false
- Takeoff:	 2020-07-15T08:03:50.810Z
- Landing:	 2020-07-15T09:07:12.619Z
SUCCESS
```

**‚úÖ Step 5c. Run unit test `Ex09_Query4c_ReadMetrics.js`** to get ALL readings (speed) from one of the journey

Open the file and locate constant `journey_id` and change value with the proper journeyID. 

```javascript
const journey_id = TimeUuid.fromString('<insert_your_id>')
const spacecraft_name = 'Crew Dragon Endeavour,SpaceX'
```
Now run the file :

```bash
node Ex09_Query4c_ReadMetrics.js 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
TODO
```

**‚úÖ Step 5d. Run unit test `Ex10_Query4c_ReadMetrics_Paging.js`** to get readings (speed) from one of the journey but page by page.

Open the file and locate constant `journey_id` and change value with the proper journeyID. 

```javascript
const journey_id = TimeUuid.fromString('<insert_your_id>')
const spacecraft_name = 'Crew Dragon Endeavour,SpaceX'
```
Now run the file :

```bash
node Ex10_Query4c_ReadMetrics_Paging.js 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
TODO
```

You are all done congratulations !
