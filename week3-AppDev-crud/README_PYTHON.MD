## 3. Connectivity to Cassandra 

**‚úÖ Step 3a. Fix unit test `Ex02_Connect_to_Cassandra.py`**

- Place you in the folder crud-python in the terminal. And install the dependencies

```
cd week3-AppDev-crud/crud-python/

pip3 install cassandra-driver
```

- Locate the file `db_connection.py` and fill the properties with your Astra informations

*Do not copy-paste - this is a sample for me.*

```python
# This is the Zip file you downloaded
SECURE_CONNECT_BUNDLE = '/Users/cedricklunven/Downloads/secure-connect-devworkshopdb.zip'
# This is the username, recommended value was KVUser
USERNAME = "todouser";
# This is the password, recommended value was KVPassword
PASSWORD = "todopassword";
# This is the keyspace name, recommended value was killrvideo
KEYSPACE = "todoapp"; 
```

```
‚ö†Ô∏è By default Autosaved is not enabled in Gitpod. Don't forget to save your modifications with CTRL+S
```

Now you can run the exercice 2 to connect

```bash
python Ex02_Connect_to_Cassandra.py 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
Your are now connected to cluster '%s' caas-cluster
Success
Closing connection (up to 10s)
========================================
```

## 4. CREATE READ UPDATE

**‚úÖ Step 4a. Run unit test `Ex03_Query5a_Insert_Journey.py`** to insert a journey in the catalog


```bash
python Ex03_Query5a_Insert_Journey.py 
```

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
Journey created 230995ee-c697-11ea-b7a1-8c85907c08dd
Success
Closing connection (up to 10s)
========================================
```

**‚úÖ Step 4b. Run unit test `Ex04_Query5b_TakeOff.py`** to update the journey and marked started.

In the previous exercises we displayed a journeyID (for me it is `230995ee-c697-11ea-b7a1-8c85907c08dd`). Open `Ex04_Query5b_TakeOff.py` locate constant `JOURNEY_ID` and change value with the proper journeyID. 

Run the takeoff query by running this test

```bash
python Ex04_Query5b_TakeOff.py
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
9..8..7..6..5..4..3..2..1 Ignition
Journey 230995ee-c697-11ea-b7a1-8c85907c08dd has now taken off
Success
========================================

```

**‚úÖ Step 4c. Run unit test `Ex05_Query5c_Travel.py`** to simulate a travel in space


```bash
python Ex05_Query5c_Travel.py 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
TODO
```

**‚úÖ Step 4d. Run unit test `Ex06_Query5d_Landing.py`** update the journey to make it inactive and provide end date. To run the test please execute:

```bash
python Ex06_Query5d_Landing.py 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
TODO
```

## 5. READ AND PARSE RESULTS

**‚úÖ Step 5a. Run unit test `Ex07_Query4a_ListJourneys.py`** to list all journeys for a 
spacecraft.

```bash
python Ex07_Query4a_ListJourneys.py 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
- Journey; 230995ee-c697-11ea-b7a1-8c85907c08dd  Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Journey; beba02a4-c696-11ea-b646-8c85907c08dd  Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS

- Journey; 87345f00-c66e-11ea-a252-4ebb2901d808  Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Journey; 84121060-c66e-11ea-a82e-f931183227ac  Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Journey; 76dceda0-c5ee-11ea-a96c-cbbdcb5d7db1  Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Journey; 691bcf60-c5ee-11ea-9bde-d1ddecb1d5c1  Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Journey; 53983d90-c5da-11ea-bcd8-c78bf1f1af98  Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Journey; 90163870-c5d6-11ea-b11f-c30e2b038000  Summary: Bring Astronauts to ISS
Success
Closing connection (up to 10s)
========================================
```

**‚úÖ Step 5b. Run unit test `Ex08_Query4b_Read_Journey_Details.py`** to get the details of one journey

```bash
python Ex08_Query4b_Read_Journey_Details.py 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
========================================
Start exercise
Journey has been found
- Uid:		  230995ee-c697-11ea-b7a1-8c85907c08dd
- Spacecraft:	 Crew Dragon Endeavour,SpaceX
- Summary:	 Bring Astronauts to ISS
- Active:	 True
- Takeoff:	 None
- Landing:	 None
Success
Closing connection (up to 10s)
========================================
```

**‚úÖ Step 5c. Run unit test `Ex09_Query4c_ReadMetrics.py`** to get ALL readings (speed) from one of the journey

```bash
python Ex09_Query4c_ReadMetrics.py 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
TODO
```

**‚úÖ Step 5d. Run unit test `Ex10_Query4c_ReadMetrics_Paging.py`** to get readings (speed) from one of the journey but page by page.

```bash
python Ex10_Query4c_ReadMetrics_Paging.py 
```

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

```bash
TODO
```

You are all done congratulations !
